# cause_chart
A chart for keeping track of challenges for cause in jury selection in a criminal trial.

The problems: 

 * Keeping track of possible challenges for cause in one place;
    - Including the potential challenges established by the State or Court,
    - Especially challenges that the State thinks it has completed, where they have not (e.g. because they have no  idea how to ask a proper commitment question) and the challenges can be defeated or the venirepeople rehabilitated.
 * Helping those helping us with voir dire (who might be interns or less-experienced lawyers) give us meaningful input.
The solution:

At a CLE some years ago, Robert Hirschhorn suggested a cause chart, with the potential reasons for cause at the top and a space for each juror.

This repository contains an iteration of the chart in .odt (OpenOffice / LibreOffice) and .pdf format.
